### About me

I am a software engineer having several years of professional experience within different roles.
I have made several [contributions to open source](https://github.com/amotl) and helped creating different online communities. Besides contributing to open source I enjoy interacting with people and tinkering with software development in general. 
Currently, I am working at [Crate.IO GmbH](https://crate.io/).
